# SchoolSystem

--Author: rthinh2002 - Peter Le Xuan Thinh

This is a project using JavaFx to represent a school managing system, where staffs and students can log in and add, remove, or view their schedule for the school year

First Task done: Create a log in page, a sign up page that will receive user data and share it to MySQL local server, the server is not public yet.

Second Task done: Retrieve username and password from the MySQL database and validate the information. Incoming task is to create the main home screen for the program

Update 10th Feb, 2021: The home page after login validation have been created, the page consists of features such as classes viewing, log out, and change student score. The profile of the user will be display with the information that they sign up for. Also, the theme for the program have been change for better design

Update 17th Feb, 2021: The classes feature has been added, though it didn't connect to any database yet. Switching between screen in home page is now avaiable.

Update 23rd Fed, 2021: The students features has been added, now we can add, delete and search students from a class, I also added error handling when the user didn't choose the class or students to drop.
Issue spotted: Their may be some similar name for students and class, the searching for the unique id will be added to make the program work fluently
